    <li>
      These questions are offered as a starting point â€“ there is great latitude in how questions can be worded; concepts within constructs may not be covered by the available set of questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Questions will most likely need to be adapted to your evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Questions can (and most likely should) be reordered to create an effective interview structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      In most scenarios, interviews should be semi-structured: questions may be asked in varying order based on the participant and not all questions may be asked of all participants depending on their role and other considerations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider prefacing these questions with broad open-ended questions to help establish rapport and to elicit grounding stories in the words of interviewees. These questions will vary depending on your scenario.
